# Price decay function of resaleable leases
This is a research project to determine price decay or valuation on leases as the lease gets closer to the check in date


There is no data out there tracking 'price decay' in rentals/leases as the date of check in approaches. 

For example say that you have a short term rental with availability starting Dec 1st, how do prices for those differ in January vs June vs November? TripsTrade can provide that data where no one else can and we'd like to build a dashboard for it so our users can check it out as well.

All data is on chain and we can use IPFS to track and store real time datapoints as well as track the Booking NFTs generated from TripsTrade
